# DSA_Practice in C

This repository contains C programs focused on practicing core **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)**. It includes implementations of common sorting algorithms, array manipulation techniques, and basic searching methods.

🧠 Topics covered:
- Sorting algorithms (Bubble, Selection, Insertion)
- Array operations (rotation, reversal, frequency, etc.)
- Searching (Linear and Binary)

⚙️ All programs are written in C and compiled for learning purposes.  
🚫 Executable (`.exe`) files are ignored from version control.

This is an ongoing collection to strengthen DSA concepts for coding interviews and academic practice.
